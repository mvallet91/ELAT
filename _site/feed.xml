&lt;p&gt;This is a weird one, and it appears once again in video records for the mobile edX app. 
When processing a record, ELAT trusts that the information is correct, and there is no way to verify 
many of the values provided.
Maybe it is possible to check if the referred course element exists, but whatever is written on the record is
assumed as the truth.
The problem here is that some records have a timestamp like they happened days before the current logfile, and
that is not possible, since the logs only record events for one day!
Look at the record below (some info was removed because it was not useful now):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &quot;accept_language&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;agent&quot;: &quot;Dalvik/2.1.0 (Linux; U; Android 6.0.1; Che1-L04 Build/Che1-L04)&quot;,
  &quot;context&quot;: {
    &quot;application&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;edx.mobileapp.android&quot;,
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.7.5&quot;
    },
    &quot;client&quot;: {
      ...client info...
    },
    &quot;component&quot;: &quot;videoplayer&quot;,
    &quot;course_id&quot;: &quot;course-v1:DelftX+AE1110x+2T2017&quot;,
    &quot;org_id&quot;: &quot;DelftX&quot;,
    &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/segmentio/event&quot;,
    &quot;received_at&quot;: &quot;2017-05-15T02:11:53.196000+00:00&quot;,
    &quot;user_id&quot;: 9999999
  },
  &quot;event&quot;: {
    ...event info...
  },
  &quot;event_source&quot;: &quot;mobile&quot;,
  &quot;event_type&quot;: &quot;seek_video&quot;,
  &quot;host&quot;: &quot;courses.edx.org&quot;,
  &quot;ip&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;edx.video.position.changed&quot;,
  &quot;page&quot;: &quot;https://courses.edx.org/xblock&quot;,
  &quot;referer&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;session&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;time&quot;: &quot;2017-05-02T06:59:46.196000+00:00&quot;,
  &quot;username&quot;: &quot;AAAAAA&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; field, it states that the record was &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;received_ at&lt;/code&gt; the 15 of May, just like all the other records of the
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;delftx-edx-events-2017-05-15.log&lt;/code&gt; file.
The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; field, however, refers to the 2 of May, at a completely different time (for all other records, the values of 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;received_at&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; had differences of less than one second).
One explanation could be if edX app takes the time of the device, and this particular user had the time wrong for some reason.
Or maybe the user downloaded, and watched a video the 2nd of May with the app offline, and did not go online until the 15 of 
May on that device.
All records of this user had &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;received_at&lt;/code&gt; within a small time frame, so it’s not useful to determine which option 
is more likely to be correct.
In addition, the official starting date of the course is May 1st, so both explanations are still plausible. 
Another case of series of video interaction records from the mobile app was found, and in this case it was very clear 
that all records were &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;received_at&lt;/code&gt; approximately the same time, but the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; of each record was throughout almost an hour.
We can assume that the mobile app allows users to interact with the video elements and then they get recorded or &lt;em&gt;received&lt;/em&gt;
when the user goes online, at a different time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the options for the date range of the graphs is “All uploaded files”, perfect if the user wants to visualize sessions
outside of the official course dates, or to verify the range of all the logfiles they have uploaded.
Some courses however, started showing values in dates that were never uploaded to the running instance of ELAT. 
The chart below shows the sessions from the 10 to 15 of May 2017, for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AE1110x-2T2017&lt;/code&gt; course, 
which runs from May 1st 2017 to March 2018. There is one session from one student the 2nd of May, and that logfile
was never processed by ELAT, which corresponds to the record shown above.
&lt;img src=&quot;/ELAT/img/barChart_badDates.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Date Error Example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the only way to find the source of this issue was to find the “out of range” session in the database, and then go 
file by file searching for the user id on the rouge session until the record appeared, showing different the value of the 
incorrect date in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; field, while the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;received_at&lt;/code&gt; field was in the correct day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;fix&quot;&gt;Fix&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the error is extremely rare, showing up for one student for one session out of thousands, and we are not sure of
the reason for this time difference, these sessions will be kept, since they belong to the time frame of the course.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Manuel</name></author><summary type="html">Mobile records strike again</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mobile Video Interaction</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ELAT/blog/2019/05/21/mobile_video/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mobile Video Interaction" /><published>2019-05-21T11:44:19+00:00</published><updated>2019-05-21T11:44:19+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ELAT/blog/2019/05/21/mobile_video</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ELAT/blog/2019/05/21/mobile_video/">&lt;h4 id=&quot;mobile-records-vs-browser-records&quot;&gt;Mobile records vs Browser records&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second special case that ELAT had to tackle, and it was caused by the introduction of the edX mobile
app, which changed the structure of video related records compared to the browser video records.
&lt;em&gt;Discovered and fixed 21/05/2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pause_video&lt;/code&gt; record looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

  &quot;username&quot;: &quot;XXXXXXXX&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The records look pretty different, and that is because the second one is for a student using the edX mobile app,
which apparently can track much more information about the device being used to interact with the video.
The important difference, however, is in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;event&lt;/code&gt; field of both records, since ELAT uses this to find the 
&lt;em&gt;id of the video&lt;/em&gt; and process the session of a student interacting with that particular video.
This is how it looks in the browser record (which was the type of record used to develop ELAT):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &quot;event&quot;: &quot;{\&quot;code\&quot;: \&quot;zppgbNoqBBI\&quot;, \&quot;id\&quot;: \&quot;ba666985e20d4eb18e593461c28790c0\&quot;, \&quot;currentTime\&quot;: 303.9990418602173}&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While for the mobile record, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;event&quot;: {
  &quot;code&quot;: &quot;mobile&quot;,
  &quot;currentTime&quot;: 33.751,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;39b0ffc9bfab486fa9ab479f64d730b3&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first one, the whole value for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;event&lt;/code&gt; field is a string, not a JSON object, therefore the&lt;br /&gt;
quotes are being &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character&quot;&gt;“escaped”&lt;/a&gt; by adding a backslash 
like this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;  in front of them. 
To process this values, ELAT had to read this string and parse it again to create a new “mini-object” 
for the event, and then read the values of each field.
The second one is a normal nested JSON object (check the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; field of both records, those are nested JSON
objects), so the quotes do not have to be escaped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we tested ELAT on newer courses (read: with mobile viewing records) some course interaction entries were being processed
with no video_id, which raised an error in the database, because it is a required field.
Then it was a matter of diving into log files, searching for the user id and date of those video interactions to find that those
records did have a video id, but in different format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;fix&quot;&gt;Fix&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may never find out why it was recorded as a string in the browser records, but as an object in the mobile app,
all we know is that ELAT has to identify video records from a mobile application and process them differently than 
the browser records.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Manuel</name></author><summary type="html">Mobile records vs Browser records This is the second special case that ELAT had to tackle, and it was caused by the introduction of the edX mobile app, which changed the structure of video related records compared to the browser video records.

&lt;p&gt;The first of many adaptations for ELAT! This was not necessarily a change on the data, but a situation that 
was not foreseen during development: some courses have many life cycles! This means that some course elements 
(like videos or quizzes) will have very similar ids, which can cause a mismatch when processing a course 
that has run in previous editions.
&lt;em&gt;Discovered and fixed 20/05/2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you remember the &lt;a href=&quot;/ELAT/docs/process&quot;&gt;process&lt;/a&gt; pipeline, once the metadata is processed, ELAT will check 
every log record for the current &lt;strong&gt;course id&lt;/strong&gt;, to avoid unnecessary processing for records of other courses.
The initial implementation, however, was only tested with courses that were first of their series, so there
was never a case where one of the courses had already happened. 
With further evaluation, it was discovered that the course id, for example &lt;strong&gt;FP101x&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;EX103x&lt;/strong&gt;, was present
in records from the 2015, 2016 and 2017 editions. Since some courses allow to be self-paced, it can happen that 
students were enrolled in a previous edition, and their interaction records appear in logs together with the records 
of students in the latest edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While testing some indicators, it was necessary to check the number of times students were interacting with the course material.
For this, ELAT would use the course elements extracted from the metadata, and compare them with the corresponding sessions
using the element id. Some sessions were interacting with elements that did not exist in the database, which caused an
error in the processing of the indicator. Those non-existent ids were dated for previous years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;fix&quot;&gt;Fix&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to fix this is by expanding the course id to include the edition, so &lt;strong&gt;FP101x&lt;/strong&gt; is now &lt;strong&gt;FP101x-3T2015&lt;/strong&gt;
