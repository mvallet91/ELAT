2. Click on **Upload Files** to show 2 upload fields, one for Metadata and one for Logfiles
3. Upload **all** metadata files for a **single course**, this should take a minute or less.
Reload the page when prompted
4. Upload all the **logfiles** (named something like _university-edx-events-2014-10-25.log.gz_) between the 
starting and ending dates of the course, this will take around **2 to 3 hours**. Once the process starts,
 tou can leave it working. Reload the page when prompted
5. Some main indicators and plots will be generated in the page, it will take a few minutes the first time
6. The processed [tables](https://github.com/AngusGLChen/DelftX-Daily-Database#database-schema) 
can be obtained in csv format for further analysis with the **download** buttons
7. (Optional) After obtaining the csv files, it is possible to delete the database by pressing the
