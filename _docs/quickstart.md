### Quick-Start Guide
1. Go to the ELAT [homepage](https://mvallet91.github.io/untitled/) on Google Chrome *(it's highly 
recommended that you close other tabs on your Chrome browser, as well as other applications on your computer)* 
2. Click on **Upload Files**
3. Upload all metadata files for a **single course** (unzipped) and reload the page when prompted
4. Upload all **logfiles** between the starting and ending dates of the course and reload the page 
when prompted
5. Some main indicators and plots will be generated in the page
6. With the **download** buttons, the processed [tables](https://github.com/AngusGLChen/DelftX-Daily-Database#database-schema) 
can be obtained in csv format for further analysis
7. (Optional) After obtaining the csv files, it is possible to delete the database by pressing the
 *Clear Database* button at the bottom. This also allows to repeat the process for another course.
