### About ELAT
ELAT is an ongoing project, currently being developed by the Delft Data Science 
[(DDS)](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/samenwerken/delft-data-science/) Initiative of the Delft University of Technology. 
It is based on an set of Python scripts that would process the logfiles and store the structured data into MySQL.
These scripts, called [edx-analysis](https://github.com/chauff/edx-analysis) were created and used for 
MOOC and Learning Analytics research by the Web Information Systems 
[(WIS)](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/web-information-systems/)
Group, and it was vital tool for multiple publications, for example:
- Gauging MOOC Learners' Adherence to the Designed Learning Path. The International Conference 
on Educational Data Mining (EDM), 2016. [link](http://www.educationaldatamining.org/EDM2016/proceedings/paper_63.pdf)
- Learning Transfer: Does It Take Place in MOOCs? An Investigation into the Uptake of Functional Programming 
in Practice. The ACM Conference on Learning at Scale (L@S), 2016. [link](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2876034.2876035)
- Encouraging Metacognition & Self-Regulation in MOOCs through Increased Learner Feedback. Workshop on 
Learning Analytics for Learners, co-located with The International Conference on Learning Analytics 
and Knowledge (LAK), 2016. [link](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1596/paper3.pdf)

Currently, the WIS Group is joining efforts with the Centre for Education and Learning 
[(CEL)](https://www.educationandlearning.nl/home) and the TU Delft 
[Extension School](https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/) to strengthen research in learning and education.
We think that more people would like to use edX data for research, so the next step is to simplify the 
use of the edx-analysis tool by creating ELAT for interested researchers that would like to avoid 
cumbersome installations and informational barriers and get straight to work with useful information.
