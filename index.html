              <p class="lead">ELAT is a simple, browser-based, fully local processing tool that can
                take the logfiles with events produced by edX and generate a database that can be
                downloaded as csv files, along with some basic indicators of students in a given edX
                course. You can start using ELAT simply by going to the
                <a href="https://mvallet91.github.io/untitled/">homepage</a> and uploading
                metadata files and logfiles (uploading to your own browser, there is no server involved).
                The code is fully available <a href="https://github.com/mvallet91/untitled">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Get started by uploading the metadata files of the course, then the logfiles in the corresponding
              time period. Once processed, the csv files for each type of session can be downloaded.
              Everything stays in your computer and everything can be deleted with a single button.

            <h3 class="text-center">Session Focused</h3>
            <p>ELAT considers a student's session as a series of events of a certain type, for example
            a video interaction session starts when a student opens a video, and the session contains
            the number of pauses, rewinds, fast forwards, etc., until the video is closed</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Primary Indicators</h3>
            <p>From the information extracted from the logfiles, ELAT automatically generates a
            few general indicators, such as the number of students per day, and the duration
            of their sessions.</p>
