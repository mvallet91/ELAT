              <p class="lead">ELAT is a simple, browser-based, fully local processing tool that can
                take the logfiles with events produced by edX and generate a database that can be
                downloaded as csv files, along with some basic indicators of students in a given
                <strong>edX</strong> course.
                It is an ongoing project developed by the Delft Data Science
                <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/samenwerken/delft-data-science/">(DDS)</a> Initiative,
                for Learning Analytics research from the Web Information Systems
                <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/web-information-systems/">(WIS)</a>
                Group together with the Centre for Education and Learning <a href="https://www.educationandlearning.nl/home">(CEL)</a>
                and the <a href="https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/">TU Delft Extension School</a>.
                You can start using ELAT simply by going to the
                <a href="https://mvallet91.github.io/untitled/">homepage</a> and uploading
                metadata files and logfiles (uploading to your own browser, there is no server involved).
                The code is fully available <a href="https://github.com/mvallet91/untitled">here</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Session Focused</h3>
            <p>ELAT considers a student's <a href="{{ "/docs/sessions/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">session</a>
              as a series of interactions with course material, such as mouse clicks, video controls or problem responses.
              ELAT processes sessions of different types, for example: a video interaction session starts when a
              student opens a video, and it contains the number of pauses, rewinds, fast forwards, etc.,
              until the video is closed.</p>

            <p> <a href="{{ "/docs/quickstart/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Get started</a> by uploading
              the metadata files of the course, then the logfiles of the corresponding time period.
              Once processed, the csv files for each type of session can be downloaded.
              No account required, everything stays in your computer and everything can be deleted with a single button.

            <h3 class="text-center">Primary Indicators</h3>
            <p>From the information extracted from the logfiles, ELAT automatically generates a
              few general indicators, such as the number of students per day, and the duration
              of their sessions. While these indicators provide a helpful overview on the processed
              information, it's just one of many <a href="{{ "/docs/use_cases/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">use cases</a>
              of ELAT in Learning Analytics, the main value is in the generated csv files.</p>
