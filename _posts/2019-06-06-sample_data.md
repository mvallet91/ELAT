#### Testing Samples Available
After the first "focus group" where ELAT was shown to interested parties in TU Delft, it was 
decided that some sample data would be very useful for more people to get a good idea of the capabilities
of the tool, without (or before) having to go through the data-gathering process of their institution.

Under the button "Sample Data", courses will be made available for interacting with the indicators and
graphs. The data cannot be downloaded, and for privacy reasons, only aggregated indicators are available, 
no individual values.
